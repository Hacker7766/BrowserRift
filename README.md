# BrowserRift üåå

> An open-source arcade of experimental web games that break the fourth wall of your browser. Play across multiple windows where actions in one tab magically affect the other.

This repository is a growing arcade of unique, browser-based games and interactive experiences built on a simple yet powerful premise: **real-time synchronization across browser windows.**

## The Vision

Our mission is to build an open-source playground that explores the creative frontier of the web browser. We are achieving this by:

-   **üéÆ Redefining Local Multiplayer:** Creating novel co-op and PvP games that two people can play on the same machine.
-   **üé® Building Interactive Art:** Designing digital toys where separate windows act as portals to a single, cohesive world.
-   **üßë‚Äçüíª Making Advanced APIs Accessible:** Demonstrating the power of `LocalStorage` and `BroadcastChannel` in a fun, hands-on way.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds! This is a perfect project for **Hacktoberfest**.

## Game Showcase

*(This section will list all the cool games we build!)*
